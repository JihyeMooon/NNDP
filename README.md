This github aims to provide the implementation of NNDP method. We will upload all significant codes that implemented for our manuscript as soon as our manuscript is accepted for publication: 1) literature data collection and pre-processing, 2) literature data model trainings, 3) semantic analysis in embedding models, 4) data visualization,  5) data classifications, and 6) Word2Vec, GloVe, and ALBERT trainings.

We only have uploded some tutorial codes for now.
