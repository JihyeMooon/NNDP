This github aims to provide the implementation of NNDP method. We will upload all significant codes that implemented for our manuscript as soon as our manuscript is accepted for publication: 1) literature data collection and pre-processing, 2) literature model trainings, 3) semantic analysis in embedding models, 4) visualization,  5) classifications, and 6) related codes for Word2Vec, GloVe, and ALBERT trainings.

We only have uploded a .ipynb file related to literature model for now.
